For a dataset \( C = \{x_i | x_i \in \mathbb{R}^d\} \) consisting of \( n \) \( d \)-dimensional vectors, each node in its \( k \)-nearest neighbor graph corresponds to a \( d \)-dimensional vector, and each node is connected to its \( k \) nearest neighbors. The time complexity of constructing the \( k \)-nearest neighbor graph using a linear scanning method is \( O(d \cdot n^2) \).
