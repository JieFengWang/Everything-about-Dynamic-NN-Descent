## Summary of *k*-NN Graph
Without loss of generality, consider a dataset C = \{x_i | x_i \in \mathbb{R}^d\} containing n points, where n is the size of the dataset and d is its dimensionality. The k-nearest neighbor graph G of dataset C is a directed graph, where each node corresponds to a d-dimensional vector data point. In this graph, each node is connected by k directed edges to its k nearest nodes under the distance metric m(·, ·) . Using an adjacency list storage method, graph G contains n k-nearest neighbor lists, with each list corresponding to a node's k neighbors. G[i] represents the k-nearest neighbor list of the i-th node, which contains k nodes sorted in ascending order of their distance to node i . These nodes are referred to as neighbors of node i , and the list G[i] defines the neighborhood of node i . For dataset C , the time complexity of constructing the k-nearest neighbor graph using a brute force method is O(d \cdot n^2) .
